## [0.3.0] - 2024-01-30

### Bug Fixes

- Extern not lib
- -e not appropriate for compiled libraries
- Explicitly instantiate remaining templated function
- Improper formatting in CI
- Use geometry:: functions rather than re-writting
- Refactor some tests to not generate as many variations
- Segfault caused by null pointer dereference after suing std::move
- Better bounds calculations taking absolute offsets into account
- Ensure pybind11>=2.11.0 is installed for python 3.12 compatibility

### Features

- Also run pytest tests automatically
- Simultaneous path integration. Useful for swarm behavior
- Re-work of API
- Discrete integration

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Build python after C++ for better debugging

### Refactor

- Use templates with explicit instantiations correctly
- Optimize CMakeLists.txt

### Testing

- Integration over area containing 2D pulse around (0,0)
- Actually run pytest tests
- Fully test the discrete and continuous paths integration function
- Continuous and discrete rectangle integration

### Reafctor

- First stage of breaking some of the larger files up

## [0.2.0] - 2023-11-24

### Bug Fixes

- Geos@3.12.0 (60edf0e5f) renamed CoordinateArraySequence to CoordinateSequence
- Pybind11 only supports py3.11 as of v2.10, and py3.12 as of v2.11

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Update cubpackpp to latest version
- Set minimum version for libgeos to be 3.11.1

### Testing

- Broader testing setup using matrix

## [0.1.0] - 2023-09-26

### Bug Fixes

- Multiline strings were merging
- Properly handle numpy inputs to MMBG by leveraging eigen
- Main -> master
- Coverage for the core of the library, not the tests
- Normalize the integrated result by N_gauss
- Return float not bool
- Vectorization causes segfaults
- Ubuntu:lunar has libgeos3.11.1 natively
- Pep-668 prevents global pip installs
- Typo (buiod -> build)

### Features

- Initial commit
- Add more features, and tests
- Add read-only properties _mus and _covs
- Vectorized calls to MMBG
- Fuzzing inputs to hopefully figure out where the non-convex error is coming from
- Fuzzing inputs to hopefully figure out where the non-convex error is coming from
- Add integration over rectangular area function
- CI pipeline for automated testing and code coverage
- Dependabot
- Optional vectorization
- Docker for benchmarking
- README.md with installation and testing instructions

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add options
- Use https now that cubpackpp is public
- Remove bullet3 for now. Unused
- Be verbose about python build type (default=Release)
- Separate BG from MMBG logic to cache often used variables
- Update changelog for v0.1.0 [skip pre-commit.ci]

### Testing

- Reduce redundant tests by using parameterization (#4)
